Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS \n \l

Welcome to the AIL-framework VM.
---

IP address: \4{eth0}

---

AIL Web UI          http://\4{eth0}:7000  (no credentials)

The default system credentials are: ail / ail

On VirtualBox port-forwarding from your host to the guest is in place.

Thus on your host you can access the URL: http://localhost:7000

If this fails, make sure the host machine is not occupying one of the forwarded ports or a firewall is active.


/!\ By launching this VM you will automatically start fetching Pastebin data from:

- slexy.org
- codepad.org
- pastebin.com

Halt the machine now if this is NOT what you want.
